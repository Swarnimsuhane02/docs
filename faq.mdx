## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are tokens in WowDev AI?

Tokens represent the units of AI usage. In WowDev AI, tokens are consumed primarily when generating or syncing projects, using the AI Chat assistant, and editing via the builder. The more complex or larger the project, the more tokens are used. We continuously optimize our platform to reduce token consumption and maximize performance.

### How many tokens do I get with each plan?

- **Free Plan**: 100,000 tokens/month  
- **Starter Plan ($20/month)**: 2.5 million tokens/month  
- **Professional Plan ($50/month)**: 7 million tokens/month  

Each plan includes full access to our core features including GitHub and Supabase integrations, the visual builder, AI chat assistant, and deployment tools.

### What happens if I run out of tokens?

You’ll receive a usage alert when you're nearing 80% of your monthly token limit. Once the limit is reached, AI-related operations (like generation, syncing, and chat) will be temporarily paused until the next billing cycle — unless you choose to upgrade your plan.

---

### Do tokens roll over to the next month?

Currently, unused tokens do not roll over to the next month. Your token balance resets with each new billing cycle.

---

### Can I switch between plans later?

Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan anytime from your WowDev AI account dashboard. Plan changes take effect immediately and token limits will adjust accordingly.

---

### Can I cancel my subscription?

Absolutely. You can cancel anytime via your account settings. Your access and token usage will continue until the end of your current billing period.

---

### Do you support teams or shared plans?

Team support is under development. For now, tokens are tied to individual accounts. If you're looking for enterprise or collaborative options, please reach out at [info@wowdev.ai](mailto:info@wowdev.ai).

---

### Do you offer annual pricing?

As of now, we only support monthly billing to give you maximum flexibility. Annual plans may be introduced in the future.
